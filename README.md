# campout

The goal of campout is to for instructors of a DataCamp course to easily
begin converting their course into an alternative format that allows
others to take their course without having to get a DataCamp
subscription. Use this if you, for instance, want to [distance yourself
from DataCamp](https://noamross.github.io/datacamp-sexual-assault/), had
your course cancelled and still want the material to be available to
others, or you disagree with other aspects of how DataCamp conducts
themselves.
