The goal of campout is to for instructors of a DataCamp course to easily begin 
converting their course into an alternative format that allows others to take
their course without having to get a DataCamp subscription. Use this if you,
for instance, want to [distance yourself from DataCamp](https://noamross.github.io/datacamp-sexual-assault/),
had your course cancelled and still want the material to be available to others,
or you disagree with other aspects of how DataCamp conducts themselves.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lwjohnst86/campout")
```

# Usage

So far there is only one conversion to the learnr tutorials, with this function:

``` r
datacamp_to_learnr_pkg("path/to/data-camp-course",
                       # Folder the new material will be converted and saved to.
                       "path/to/new-learnr-package",
                       "Your name here")
```

- **Note**: This roughly converts your DataCamp material to the learnr tutorial 
format... it is *not* perfect!! So please make sure to look through all your 
material before publicizing!
- Also *note*, so far the slides only only converted to a text document, they
are not slides. If you have the original videos of the slides, you can insert
the video link into the chapter documents, which will then include the video
files for you in the tutorial.
