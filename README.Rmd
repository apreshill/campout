The goal of campout is to for instructors of a DataCamp course to easily begin 
converting their course into an alternative format that allows others to take
their course without having to get a DataCamp subscription. Use this if you,
for instance, want to [distance yourself from DataCamp](https://noamross.github.io/datacamp-sexual-assault/),
had your course cancelled and still want the material to be available to others,
or you disagree with other aspects of how DataCamp conducts themselves.
