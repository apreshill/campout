# campout

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of campout is to for instructors of a DataCamp course to easily begin 
converting their course into an alternative format that allows others to take
their course without having to get a DataCamp subscription. Use this if you,
for instance, want to [distance yourself from DataCamp](https://noamross.github.io/datacamp-sexual-assault/),
had your course cancelled and still want the material to be available to others,
or you disagree with other aspects of how DataCamp conducts themselves.

## Installation
